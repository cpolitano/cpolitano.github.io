*Portfolio*
=========

I'm a Creative Technologist at digital agency [ISL](http://istrategylabs.com/), where I work with a world-class dev team to craft stunning digital experiences. In 2014 I completed the rigorous Web Development Immersive at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/), where over the course of 12 weeks I learned Ruby, Rails, Git, SQL, and JavaScript. Right now I'm learning about WebGL, Python/Django, and Go, and expanding my knowledge of JS frameworks and libraries, particularly Node and Angular. I love building APIs and I get excited about projects with positive social impact.

When I started at ISL as a Developer Apprentice, I built a series of apps to improve my skills and learn about ISL's stacks. I started off with an Angular-based quiz game about the company, including a leaderboard, new question submission, and data persisted to Parse. Next I built an Angular app for social media monitoring of brand posts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Finally, I built a Node Webkit app with a Google Maps visualization to search for Instagram influencers based on location, hashtag, or account followed.
