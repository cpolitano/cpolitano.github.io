*Portfolio*
=========

I'm a Creative Technologist at digital agency [http://istrategylabs.com/](ISL), where I work with a world-class dev team to craft stunning digital experiences. In 2014 I completed the rigorous Web Development Immersive at [https://generalassemb.ly/](General Assembly), where over the course of 12 weeks I learned Ruby on Rails, Git, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript. Right now I'm learning about WebGL, Python/Django, and Go, and expanding my knowledge of JS frameworks and libraries. I love working with social media APIs and I get excited about building projects with positive social impact.

When I started at ISL as a Developer Apprentice, I built a series of apps to improve my skills and learn about ISL's technology stacks. I started off with an Angular-based quiz game about the company, including a leaderboard, new question submission, and data persisted to Parse. Next I built an Angular app for social media monitoring of client posts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Finally, I built a Node Webkit app with a Google Maps visualization to search for Instagram influencers based on location, hashtag, or account followed.

This is my portfolio site to display full stack web development work. A lightweight static site, I'm using HTML and CSS, with Velocity.js on vanilla JavaScript. See it live at [clarepolitano.com](http://clarepolitano.com).
